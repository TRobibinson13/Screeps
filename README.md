Selling Points:
I like video games and want to do more coding, so this is a great way to do both.  Its JavaScript based, which I don’t have much practice in, so i’m also going to check out the recommended Java Script Tutorial (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).  I’ll take notes as I go through the course, then highlight key points once I start playing so I can hopefully motivate others to play too.
